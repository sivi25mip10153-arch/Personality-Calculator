#  Simple Personality Calculator (MCQ Based)

This repository contains a **Python console application** designed to offer a quick, accessible personality assessment.

##  Project Summary

The **Personality Calculator** provides a brief, fun alternative to lengthy psychological tests. It uses a set of **10 multiple-choice questions (MCQs)** to determine a user's personality profile.

##  How it Works

1.  **Input & Scoring:** The program prompts the user for answers to 10 questions. Each choice is scored from 0 to 10 points.
2.  **Calculation:** The total score is calculated and converted into a **percentage** of the maximum possible score (100%).
3.  **Classification:** This percentage is mapped to one of **seven personality types** (e.g., ISTJ, INFP) inspired by general psychological frameworks.

##  Personality Types Determined

The final result is classified into one of the following types based on the user's score percentage:

* **ISTJ** (Practical, Organized)
* **ISFJ** (Friendly, Responsible)
* **INFJ** (Insightful, Focused)
* **INTJ** (Independent, Analytical)
* **ISTP** (Calm, Highly Independent)
* **ISFP** (Quiet, Creative)
* **INFP** (Idealistic, Curious)

## 📌 Note

This tool is designed for **entertainment and self-reflection** and is not intended to be a scientifically validated psychological assessment.
