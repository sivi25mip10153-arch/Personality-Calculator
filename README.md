## about the problem :-
As we all know, people around the world have various personality types, and many are curious to learn more about them, including their kindness, understanding, logic, and intelligence. However, comprehensive personality tests can often be lengthy and complicated.

This is why we need a simple personality calculator that can ask a few questions and categorize individuals into specific personality types.Now, full personality tests are sometimes lengthy and complicated.
